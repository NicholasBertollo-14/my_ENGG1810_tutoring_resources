This is just a practice question
The problems begin with Q1

You can start reading before I say Go, however you cannot type until then
You cannot use outside libraries other than the math library
Do not delete your solution once you are done, you might need it for more problems. 

Normal rules apply, if a function trivialises the solution
then you cannot use it.
Writing on paper is fine, however I recommend opening your IDE
or opening a workspace and uploading this folder.

Whoever gets it first, wins! 
Hands up if you think you're done, I need to check your solution. 

It is required that most people solve the question before
we move on, therefore put your hand up!

They are in not in order of difficulty!
I recommend thinking about the problem before you start typing!
Goodluck!

    Returns list where each element is to the power of power
