Function vs Method and syntactic difference

Collections:
In python they can contain anything
Lists:
    Create and annotate
    Get, append, pop
Tuple:
    Create and annotate
Set: (do dictionaries at the same time)
    Create ({} doesn't work) and annotate
    add (more when considering for loops)
Dictionary:
    Create  and annotate
    add an item, get an item

Conditionals (< and >=)
More on booleans:
    and and or

Control flow:
    if, elif, else
