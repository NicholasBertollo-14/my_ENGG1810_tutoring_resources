Basically the rest of the semester will be using content from
the last 5-6 weeks as though you know it. 
You know:
 - collections
 - control flow
 - importing
 - matplotlib
 - exceptions
 - file opening and manipulation
 - basic regex
 - functions and function scope

This includes good coding practices such as:
 - Not using global variables.
 - Using a main function in almost every program.
 - Using spaces between binary operators.
 - Using annotations and comments.
 - Using functions to create modular code.
 - Making all python files both scripts and modules.
