# Introduction to Engineering Computing

Here are my resources I created for my students in ENGG1810 Sem 2 2024.
They were a work in progress, ready to be expanded on, however ENGG1810
then started to be run by a school different to computer science and
that coordinator only wanted to work with mechanical engineers I believe.
